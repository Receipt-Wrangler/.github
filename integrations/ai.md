# Introduction

Receipt Wrangler has the ability to use OCR to pull data off of images, and AI to parse that data into a receipt. There are a couple of workflows which the user can use to create receipts quicker with AI.

## Quick Scan

The first workflow is quick scan. Quick scan is located on the receipts page, and this allows users to quickly scan a receipt, and have the data parsed into a receipt and immediately saved.
Defaults for some of the fields can be set in user preferences, to make the process even quicker.
