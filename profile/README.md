# ðŸ§¾ Introduction ðŸ§¾

Welcome, thanks for taking a look! Receipt Wrangler is an easy to use self hosted Receipt manager.
The goal of Receipt Wrangler is to allow users to:

- Create receipts effortlessly and quickly
- Catagorize receipts, to search on and filter by
- Share receipts amongst system users
- Keep track of who owes who at any given time

I personally daily drive Receipt Wrangler to keep track of my expenses with my significant other, and I hope that Receipt Wrangler can help you wrangle your receipts as well!

# Getting Started

We'll go step by step in getting everything installed.

Step 1: Set up docker-compose.yaml

- [Examples](https://github.com/Receipt-Wrangler/.github/tree/main/examples)

Step 2: Set up config.prod.json
This config needs to be in the directory that gets mounted to /go/api/config from the docker-compose.yaml above.
The connection string will be moved out to simplify the deployment process in the future.

```json
{
  "openAiKey": "keyHere",
  "secretKey": "randomlyGeneratedSecureString"
}
```

Step 3: Set up feature-config.prod.json
This config also needs to be in the directory that gets mounted to /go/api/config

```json
{
  "aiPoweredReceipts": false,
  "enableLocalSignUp": false
}
```

Step 4:

**If you are using the proxy container in the docker compose stack, skip this step**

Forward api calls to backend
Lastly, we need to forward api calls to backend if you are not using the preconfigured proxy from the proxy.
Below is an example using NGINX proxy manager. The path at / is what is being exposed to the internet. Without this the requests sent to paths at /api/ will not make it to the backend. Instead, the frontend will attempt to interpert that route.
This is something I would like to address within the docker compose, but haven't quite gotten around to it yet.

Step 5: Deploy

If using the proxy container, deploy the stack and point all traffic to the proxy container.
If you are not using the proxy container, point all traffic to the frontend container.

# After Deployment

After the app is deployed, a default user will be created with the following credentials:
username: admin
password: admin

Your credentials can be changed by opening the sidebar, clicking on your user avatar on the top left hand corner and then clicking settings.
There in the user profile, your displayname and username can be changed.

For now, your username cannot be changed from this screen, but can be changed from the the manage users list. This will be remidied in the future.

Now it's time to wrangle!
